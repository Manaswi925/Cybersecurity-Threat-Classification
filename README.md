# Cybersecurity-Threat-Classification

Project Overview
This project involves training and evaluating a machine learning classification model. The implementation primarily uses RandomForestClassifier and evaluates the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
             -Loads dataset and splits it into training and testing sets.
             -Feature selection using SelectKBest.

2. Model Training & Evaluation
            -Trains multiple classifiers (Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Bagging, and AdaBoost).
            -Evaluates models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC score.
   
3. Random Forest Classifier Results
            -Predicts test data using RandomForestClassifier and displays classification report and confusion matrix.
